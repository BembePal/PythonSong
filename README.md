Example:

The tuple consist of the elements, the **first element** is **string** which represent a **lyrics**, and the **second element** is a **float** on **how fast the letter is printed**.
("Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh",0.14)


However, the **delay** indicates how long you will have to wait for the following line to be displayed; the first element indicates a 1-second delay.
 delays = [1,1,1, 0.90, 1.30, 1.60, 1.50, 1.50, 1.40, 1.60]
